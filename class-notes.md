### Class notes `Chapter - 06 Exploring the world` (14/01/2023)

Revising last chapter - useState() and Hooks 

Why React is fast ?

It's because of its fast DOM manipulation -> Using Reconciliation (diff algorithm)

Why use state ? 

React only tracks variables which are state variables.



In this chapter, we are going to get data from outside our application through API. Earlier, we got data from mock data. 

Monolithic Architecture -> Both Client & Server running in the same system 

Micro Services -> Separate projects for Client & Server and lot of services for specific funtionality 

SoC (Separation of Concern) -> Every service in microservices serves a single functionality 


We are going to build -> UI microservices 

UI microservices -> Explore the world through API 


fetch -> to call API

on page load -> fetch the api data and show all the restaurants 

Two approaches : 
1. On load -> call API -> render
2. on load -> render some defaults -> call API -> updates UI 

React Hook -> useEffect() -> render something -> do some operation -> update the UI


useEffect(callback) -> useEffect will call callback function after intial render if there are no dependencies (only once)

What if we want to re-render after every state changes -> Pass state in dependency array. 


When component re-renders ? when state/props changes 


useEffect (callback, [dependencies]);


Where to make API call ?

useEffect(()=>{
  //API call 
},[])



Steps : 

1. First, component will be rendered
2. useEffect() and render with intial data
3. When API call is made, 


Shimmer -> 


Conditional rendering 

  
On page load, shimmer UI  -> when restaurants empty 
when res data -> actual data UI 

Early return -> not render 



How to avoid rendering components ? optional chaining or
