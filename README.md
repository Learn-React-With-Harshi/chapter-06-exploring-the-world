# `Learn React With Harshi 👩🏻‍💻 Series`
   Documenting my learning journey of [Namaste React Live Course](https://learn.namastedev.com/) conducted by Akshay Saini

## Class Summary `Chapter - 06 Exploring the world` (14/01/2023)

Until last chapter, we were using mock data to render the UI. In this chapter, we learnt about working with real time data from the Web (Our world basically). Then, we covered different types of System Architectures, different approaches to fetch API and render in UI. Today's important concept was one of the basic React Hooks `useEffect`. We tried using useEffect in all combinations and understanding it in depth. Importance of conditional rendering and Shimmer in UI were explained. 


One line about this chapter : `React is called react because it reacts to every state change and renders only the component in which the state is present`
